# Meeting 1: July 7 2016

Keren should be emailing us the list of stuff to do, but until then, these are the notes from the meeting:

## Due by Next Week:
Finished 1. Finish Categorizing Unit 1 & 2 from the Question Bank.
Finished 2. Sort the Questions by Unit -> Lesson -> [Easy | Medium | Difficult]
3. Open `Group_Activity_Logic.docx` from dropbox and overwrite contents to reflect a logic group activity. Existing contents are an example for us to see.
4. For Units 1 & 2, add explanations to the answers for difficult questions. Make sure to explain _why_ an answer is correct.
Lunchtime tomorrow 5. Email Book publisher and request access. If they say no, purchase 2 copies outright and Farhana will reimburse us.

## Notes
* Farhana said she'd like to see a group prolog programming activity for Logic. Maybe the family example or a simple traffic lights program. Use this to highlight how predicate logic works.
* A guided assignment (giving instructions along the way) would make sure that students who aren't very tech savvy can still get by.
* We could use an online Prolog execution environment to save students from having to install prolog and get things going. [This one](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_prolog_online.php) might be a good one to use
* For the Question Bank, Farhana said if there weren't enough questions to fill the Easy/Medium/Difficult categories with questions we should make new questions from the pages in the textbook. The relevant pages are listed in `Unit_Info_V2.docx`
