* Answer sheets for Set 2 weekly challenges.

## Powerpoint Questions

The idea is that students have a non intimidating way to practice. It'll have animations and transitions added to make it interactive.

* Questions based on slides, readings, online links.
* 1 presentation per week of questions
* 10 powerpoint questions per course week
	* first slide is multiple choice questions
	* second slide is duplicate but with correct/incorrect
	* Third slide is a copy of the lecture slide the question is based on
* See `/Instructional Material/Assesments/Self_assesment/Unit1_L11_example.pptx`
* Can use questions from the question bank to make the questions
* Ideally the questions will have images/diagrams in them.
