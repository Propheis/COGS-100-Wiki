## Powerpoint Questions

Note: **Can use questions from the question bank to make the questions**

The idea is that students have a non intimidating way to practice. It'll have animations and transitions added to make it interactive.

* Questions based on slides, readings, online links.
* 1 presentation per week of questions
* 10 powerpoint questions per course week
* Each question consists of three slides:
	1. Multiple choice question
	2. Same question but with correct/incorrect indications
	3. Copy/Screenshot of the lecture slide the question is based on
* See `/Instructional Material/Assesments/Self_assesment/Unit1_L11_example.pptx`
* Ideally the questions will have images/diagrams in them.
